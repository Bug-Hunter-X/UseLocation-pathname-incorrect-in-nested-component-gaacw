In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the 
`useLocation` hook's `pathname` property within a component that's not directly rendered by a route can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  This often manifests as an initial render with an incorrect or empty pathname, or an inability to update the pathname when navigation occurs.  The problem stems from the hook's reliance on the routing context, which might not be available at the desired time or place.
